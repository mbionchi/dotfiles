==================

  My collection of config files.  Duh.

  Use at your own risk -- you'll probably need to tweak some of them
according to your system.

  Below is the list of dependencies/comments (if any) on per-file basis:

  * .vimrc
      - requires airline plugin: https://github.com/bling/vim-airline
      - requires euphrasia colorscheme: included here in .vim/colors/

  * .i3/exec.sh
      - requires all of the following: conky, urxvt, lm_sensors,
        nm-applet (from NetworkManager), openssh, mpd, redshift

  * .i3/exec_always.sh
      - requires: xmodmap, .fehbg.sh (from this repo), compton

  * .i3/config
      - requires alsa-tools, dmenu, urxvt, i3lock, i3bar, mpc, 
        as well as 2 monitors and extra keyboard keys found on japanese
        thinkpad keyboards and probably something else :)

  * .fehbg.sh
      - requires feh (duh) and a '.bg.png' file in the home directory

  * .Xmodmap
      - you should be able to guess this one...

  * .conkyrc:
      - this version produces JSON output needed for the i3bar.  To be
      used with .i3/conkywrap.sh
